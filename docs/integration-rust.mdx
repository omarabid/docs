### Profiling Rust applications

Add the `pyroscope` crate to your Cargo.toml:

```bash
cargo add pyroscope
```

### Minimal Configuration

At a minimum, you need to provide the URL of the Pyroscope Server and the name of your application. This does not start profiling but only configure the agent.

```rust
let mut agent =
PyroscopeAgent::builder("http://localhost:4040", "myapp")
.build()?;
```

You can start profiling by invoking

```rust
 agent.start();
```

The agent can be stopped at any point, and it'll send a last report to the server. The agent can be restarted at a later point.

```rust
 agent.stop();
```

### Tags

Tags can be added or removed after the agent is started. The function `add_tags` accepts a vector of `(&str, &str)`. The first element in the tuple is the key and the second element is the value.

```rust
// Configure the agent
let agent = PyroscopeAgent::builder("http://localhost:8080", "my-app").build().unwrap();

// Start Profiling
agent.start();

// Profiled code (with no tags) 

// Add tags to the agent
agent.add_tags(vec![("tag", "value")]).unwrap();

// This portion will be profiled with the specified tag. 

// Stop the agent 
agent.stop();
```

To remove tags, you can call `remove_tags` with a vector of `&str` that contains the key of the tag to remove.

```rust
agent.remove_tags(vec!["tag"]).unwrap();
```

### Full Configuration

The agent accepts additional initial parameters.

- **Backend**: Profiler used, do not set this if you are profiling Rust applications. Default is Pprof.
- **Sample Rate**: Sampling Frequency in Hertz. Default is 100.
- **Tags**: Initial tags.

```rust
let mut agent =
PyroscopeAgent::builder("http://localhost:4040", "myapp")
// Profiler
.backend(Pprof::default())
// Sample rate
.sample_rate(100)
// Tags
.tags(vec![("env", "dev")])
// Create the agent
.build()?;
```


### Technical Details

- **Backend**: The Pyroscope Agent uses [pprof-rs](https://github.com/tikv/pprof-rs) as a backend. As a result, the [limitations](https://github.com/tikv/pprof-rs#why-not-) for pprof-rs also applies.
- **Tagging**: Adding or removing tags is not possible within threads. In general, the [Pyroscope Agent](https://docs.rs/pyroscope/latest/pyroscope/pyroscope/struct.PyroscopeAgent.html) is not Sync; and as a result a reference cannot be shared between threads. A multi-threaded program could be profiled but the agent is not thread-aware and a particular thread cannot be tagged.
- **Timer**: epoll (for Linux) and kqueue (for macOS) are required for a more precise timer.
- **Shutdown**: The Pyroscope Agent might take some time (usually less than 10 seconds) to shutdown properly and drop its threads.

### Examples


#### Library Examples

Several examples are available that can showcase how the library can be used. These examples could be run from the library repository.

For example, to run the `tags` example.

```bash
cargo run --example tags 
```
